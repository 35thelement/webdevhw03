Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?

Ben Romine

2. What hostname did you deploy to for Task 2?

hw03.element35.org

3. What's the URL of your git repo for Task 2?

The URL is https://github.com/35thelement/webdevhw03

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?

I completed it all. The calc method works, the palindrome method works,
the factor method works, and the previously set up double method works.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?

I deployed successfully.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say about a 7.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

I had trouble with the calc part of the assignment until I discovered
that Elixir had a function similar to Javascript's eval() function.
All I needed to do from there was come up with a regex to ensure that
the string being input was properly formatted.
